# HW3-PasswordGenerator

## Description
This homework assignment is focused on building a password generator.
In this homework I was given starter code and I only needed to add the generate password function to the javascript file.


### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## My Process
1. Physically wrote out the process needed to be done by the code
2. Wrote each individual part of code using if statements: each prompt and requirement
3. Determined that I needed some type of loop to insert the different criteria into an array
4. Decided a while loop would fit the best and enclosed criteria inside 
5. Looked over code, consolidated it, and organized it
6. Debugged code
7. Realized I had to adjust pass function to output the password
8. Realized I need to look up an array method to format my output password correctly.
9. Needed to change the name of my function to work perfectly with pre-existing code
10. Look over code again for possible errors
